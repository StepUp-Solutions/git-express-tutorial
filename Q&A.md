1. What is a Git Repository (Repo)?
   - **A central location where all your project's files, history, and metadata are stored.**
   - A specific version of your project's files.
   - A tool for finding the commit that introduced a bug.

2. What is the purpose of a Commit in Git?
   - To track changes and identify who made modifications.
   - To upload local changes to a remote repository.
   - **Both A and B.**

3. What is a Branch in Git?
   - **An independent line of development in your repository, allowing parallel work without disrupting the main project.**
   - A copy of your repository hosted on an external server.
   - A specific version of your project's files.

4. What does a Remote Repository enable?
   - **Collaboration, backup, and additional features like issue tracking and pull requests.**
   - Temporary saving of unresolved changes.
   - Integration of changes from various sources, ensuring the repository remains up-to-date.

5. What is the difference between Git Reset and Git Revert?
   - Git Reset updates the current branch to a specified commit, while Git Revert creates a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.
   - **Git Reset potentially discards changes, while Git Revert preserves the commit history.**
   - Git Reset is used for temporary changes, while Git Revert is used for permanent changes.

6. What is Git Stash used for?
   - To track changes and identify who made modifications.
   - **To temporarily save unresolved changes, allowing you to switch branches or work on other tasks without committing incomplete work.**
   - To mark releases, versions, or milestones in your project.

7. What is a Pull Request (PR) in Git?
   - **A proposed change to a repository, submitted for review and approval by others.**
   - **A way to integrate changes from different branches or collaborators.**
   - A bookmark for a specific commit, often used to mark releases, versions, or milestones.

8. How does Git LFS (Large File Storage) help in managing large files?
   - **By reducing repository size, improving performance, and simplifying collaboration.**
   - By enabling modular dependencies and external collaborations.
   - By enforcing coding standards and automating testing.

9. What is the purpose of Git Hooks?
   - To manage large files in Git repositories.
   - **To enforce coding standards, automate testing, and enhance the development workflow.**
   - To integrate specific changes and maintain a clean history.

10. What is Git Rebase used for?
    - To manage large files in Git repositories.
    - To temporarily save unresolved changes.
    - **To maintain a clean, linear commit history and simplify conflict resolution.**

11. What is the purpose of Git Ignore (.gitignore)?
    - To specify files or directories that Git should ignore in a repository.
    - **To keep unwanted files out of your repository, reducing clutter and maintaining focus on relevant code.**
    - To resolve conflicts that occur when merging changes.

13. Why are Pull Requests used in Git?
    - **To facilitate collaborative development, code review, and quality control.**
    - To mark releases, versions, or milestones in your project.
    - To resolve conflicts that occur when merging changes.

14. What is the purpose of Git Stash?
    - To track changes and identify who made modifications.
    - **To temporarily save unresolved changes, allowing you to switch branches or work on other tasks without committing unfinished work.**
    - To mark releases, versions, or milestones in your project.

15. What are the two main types of Git commits?
    - **Committing staged changes and committing workspace changes.**
    - Committing local changes and pushing to remote changes.
    - Committing on the feature branch and committing on the main branch.

16. When should Pull Requests be used in the Git workflow?
    - **After pushing a new feature branch to the remote repository, to facilitate code review.**
    - Before making any local changes to your repository.
    - Only when merge conflicts occur.

17. What is the first step when starting work on a new feature in Git?
    - Commit directly to the main branch.
    - **Create a new branch for the feature.**
    - Submit a Pull Request.

19. What happens after a Pull Request is approved and merged?
    - **The changes from the feature branch are integrated into the main branch.**
    - The feature branch is automatically deleted.
    - A new release tag is created.

20. When should you use "git reset" versus "git revert"?
    - Use "git reset" to undo commits that have not yet been pushed and "git revert" to undo commits that have already been shared.
    - **Use "git reset" for undoing commits in your local history and "git revert" for undoing changes from a previous commit while preserving the commit history.**
    - Use "git reset" to resolve merge conflicts and "git revert" to create pull requests.
